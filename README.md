# Introduction

This is a database that I created for a museum with Angular JS. It has two tables filled with json data, and different filters for sorting. It was created with AngularJS.

The most important files are:
  * **index.html**: This file represents the html structure of the webapp.
  * **/css**: Inside this folder you will find our styling sheet. The custom styles are defined in **custom.css**.
  * **/daten**: Inside this folder you will find the database based on json objects.
	* **/js**: Here are all the important javascript files including **app.js** where you can find the AngularJS code.

# Requirements
